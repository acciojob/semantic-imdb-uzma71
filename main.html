		3 Idiots is a Bollywood production that flashes back and forth between present day, and the characters' time in college. It starts off with old friends, Qureshi and Raju Rastogi learning that their college pal, Rancho, had finally been found. The movie follows their travels to find their long lost friend, while flashing back to the events of their school years, where they often got into amusing shenanigans involving the Dean of Delhi's Imperial College of Engineering, Viru Sahastrabudhe, and dealt with some serious events that many people encounter in every day life.

		<p>1- “Ever since we were young, we believed that life was a race. If we didn’t run fast enough, we would be trampled and overtaken. Man, even to be born, we had to race 300 million sperm.” – Farhan, ‘3 Idiots’.<br>

2- “A cuckoo bird never makes its own nest. She lays eggs on other birds nests. And when her babies come to the world, what do they do first? They kick out the other eggs from the nest. Competition over. Their life begins with murder. That’s nature. Compete. Or die.” – Virus, ‘3 Idiots’.</p>
